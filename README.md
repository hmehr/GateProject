GATE Project
===========

General Architecture for Text Engineering or GATE is a Java suite of tools originally developed at the University of Sheffield beginning in 1995 and now used worldwide by a wide community of scientists, companies, teachers and students for all sorts of natural language processing tasks, including information extraction in many languages.

As part of "Semantic Computing" course in September 2012, we incorporated GATE to create a plugin.
The plugin would mine textual data and extracts certain piece of information according to the rules defined in JAPE transducers. 
The main piece of entities are all the quotes that have been said by a person who has a position in a university.
